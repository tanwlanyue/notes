# [The Definitive C++ Book Guide and List](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388242/the-definitive-c-book-guide-and-list)

这个提问试图从每年出版的众多质量不高的C++书籍中筛选出少数几本精品。

与其他许多编程语言不同，通常可以通过互联网上的教程边做边学，很少有人能够不通过阅读一本写得好的C++书籍就快速掌握C++。C++的庞大和复杂性使得这几乎不可能。事实上，C++的庞大和复杂性导致市面上存在许多非常糟糕的C++书籍。我们所说的糟糕，不仅仅是风格问题，而是诸如明显的事实错误和推广极其糟糕的编程风格之类的问题。

## Beginner

### Introductory, no previous programming experience

| Book                                                         | Author(s)                                                    | Description                                                  | review                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [*C++ Primer*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0321714113)*  * Not to be confused with [*C++ Primer Plus*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0672326973) (Stephen Prata), with a significantly less favorable [review](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2002/glassborow_1744). | Stanley Lippman, Josée Lajoie, and Barbara E. Moo (**updated for C++11**) | Coming at 1k pages, this is a very thorough introduction into C++ that covers just about everything in the language in a very accessible format and in great detail. The fifth edition (released August 16, 2012) covers C++11. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2012/glassborow_1848) |
| [*Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0138308683) | Bjarne Stroustrup, 3rd Edition - April 22, 2024 (**updated for C++20/C++23**) | An introduction to programming using C++ by the creator of the language. A good read, that assumes no previous programming experience, but is not only for beginners. |                                                              |

### Introductory, with previous programming experience

| Book                                                         | Author(s)                                                    | Description                                                  | review                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [*A Tour of C++*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0136816487) | Bjarne Stroustrup (**[2nd edition for C++17](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0134997832)**, **[3rd edition for C++20](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0136816487)**) | The “tour” is a quick (about 180 pages and 14 chapters) tutorial overview of all of standard C++ (language and standard library, **and using C++11**) at a moderately high level for people who already know C++ or at least are experienced programmers. This book is an extended version of the material that constitutes Chapters 2-5 of The C++ Programming Language, 4th edition. |                                                              |
| [*Accelerated C++*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/020170353X) | Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo, 1st Edition - August 24, 2000 | This basically covers the same ground as the *C++ Primer*, but does so in a quarter of its space. This is largely because it does not attempt to be an introduction to *programming*, but an introduction to *C++* for people who've previously programmed in some other language. It has a steeper learning curve, but, for those who can cope with this, it is a very compact introduction to the language. (Historically, it broke new ground by being the first beginner's book to use a modern approach to teaching the language.) Despite this, the C++ it teaches is purely C++98. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2000/glassborow_1185) |

### Best practices

| Book                                                         | Author(s)                                | Description                                                  | review                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [*Effective C++*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0321334876) | Scott Meyers, 3rd Edition - May 22, 2005 | This was written with the aim of being the best second book C++ programmers should read, and it succeeded. Earlier editions were aimed at programmers coming from C, the third edition changes this and targets programmers coming from languages like Java. It presents ~50 easy-to-remember rules of thumb along with their rationale in a very accessible (and enjoyable) style. For C++11 and C++14 the examples and a few issues are outdated and Effective Modern C++ should be preferred. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/1998/glassborow_700) |
| [*Effective Modern C++*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1491903996) | Scott Meyers                             | This book is aimed at C++ programmers making the transition from C++03 to C++11 and C++14. This book can be treated as a continuation and "correction" of some parts of the previous book - "Effective C++". They don't cover the same things, but keep similar item-based themes. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2019/floyd_1937)    |
| [*Effective STL*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201749629) | Scott Meyers                             | This aims to do the same to the part of the standard library coming from the STL what *Effective C++* did to the language as a whole: It presents rules of thumb along with their rationale. |                                                              |

| [*More Exceptional C++*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/020170434X) | Herb Sutter                               | Covers additional exception safety topics not covered in *Exceptional C++*, in addition to discussion of effective object-oriented programming in C++ and correct use of the STL. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2002/glassborow_784) |
| [*Exceptional C++ Style*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201760428) | Herb Sutter                               | Discusses generic programming, optimization, and resource management; this book also has an excellent exposition of how to write modular code in C++ by using non-member functions and the single responsibility principle. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2005/goodliffe_107) |
| [*C++ Coding Standards*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0321113586) | Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu       | “Coding standards” here doesn't mean “how many spaces should I indent my code?” This book contains 101 best practices, idioms, and common pitfalls that can help you to write correct, understandable, and efficient C++ code. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2004/glassborow_1439) |
| [*C++ Templates: The Complete Guide*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201734842) | David Vandevoorde and Nicolai M. Josuttis | This is *the* book about templates as they existed before C++11. It covers everything from the very basics to some of the most advanced template metaprogramming and explains every detail of how templates work (both conceptually and at how they are implemented) and discusses many common pitfalls. Has excellent summaries of the One Definition Rule (ODR) and overload resolution in the appendices. A [second edition](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0321714121) covering C++11, C++14 and C++17 has been already published. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2020/floyd_1946)    |
| [*C++ 17 - The Complete Guide*](https://leanpub.com/cpp17)   | Nicolai M. Josuttis                       | This book describes all the new features introduced in the C++17 Standard covering everything from the simple ones like 'Inline Variables', 'constexpr if' all the way up to 'Polymorphic Memory Resources' and 'New and Delete with over aligned Data'. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2020/floyd_1943)    |
| [*C++ 20 - The Complete Guide*](https://leanpub.com/cpp20)   | Nicolai M. Josuttis                       | This book presents all the new language and library features of C++20. It covers the motivation and context of each new feature with examples and background information. The focus is on how these features impact day-to-day programming, what it means to combine them, and how to benefit from C++20 in practice. (Note that this book was **published step-by-step**, and the first edition is now complete.) |                                                              |

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [*Modern C++ Design*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201704315) | Andrei Alexandrescu                 | A groundbreaking book on advanced generic programming techniques. Introduces policy-based design, type lists, and fundamental generic programming idioms then explains how many useful design patterns (including small object allocators, functors, factories, visitors, and multi-methods) can be implemented efficiently, modularly, and cleanly using generic programming. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2001/glassborow_979) |
| [*C++ Template Metaprogramming*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0321227255) | David Abrahams and Aleksey Gurtovoy |                                                              |                                                              |
| [*C++ Concurrency In Action*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1933988770) | Anthony Williams                    | A book covering C++11 concurrency support including the thread library, the atomics library, the C++ memory model, locks and mutexes, as well as issues of designing and debugging multithreaded applications. A [second edition](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1617294691) covering C++14 and C++17 has already been published. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2012/glassborow_1850) |
| [*Advanced C++ Metaprogramming*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1460966163) | Davide Di Gennaro                   | A pre-C++11 manual of TMP techniques, focused more on practice than theory. There are a ton of snippets in this book, some of which are made obsolete by type traits, but the techniques, are nonetheless useful to know. If you can put up with the quirky formatting/editing, it is easier to read than Alexandrescu, and arguably, more rewarding. For more experienced developers, there is a good chance that you may pick up something about a dark corner of C++ (a quirk) that usually only comes about through extensive experience. |                                                              |

Lakos explains battle-tested techniques to manage very big C++ software projects. If you work in a big C++ software project this is a great read, detailing the relationship between physical and logical structure, strategies for components, and their reuse. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2020/bruntlett_1953/) |

| [*The C++ Programming Language*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0321958322) | Bjarne Stroustrup (**updated for C++11**) | The classic introduction to C++ by its creator. Written to parallel the classic K&R, this indeed reads very much like it and covers just about everything from the core language to the standard library, to programming paradigms to the language's philosophy. | [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/2014/lenton_1853) Note: All releases of the C++ standard are tracked in the question "*[Where do I find the current C or C++ standard documents?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/81656/where-do-i-find-the-current-c-or-c-standard-documents)*". |

## Classics / Older

**Note:** Some information contained within these books may not be up-to-date or no longer considered best practice.

- [*The Design and Evolution of C++*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201543303) (Bjarne Stroustrup) If you want to know *why* the language is the way it is, this book is where you find answers. This covers everything *before the standardization* of C++.
- [*Ruminations on C++*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201423391) - (Andrew Koenig and Barbara Moo) [[Review\]](https://accu.org/bookreviews/1997/glassborow_776)
- [*Advanced C++ Programming Styles and Idioms*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201548550) (James Coplien) A predecessor of the pattern movement, it describes many C++-specific “idioms”. It's certainly a very good book and might still be worth a read if you can spare the time, but quite old and not up-to-date with current C++.
- [*Large Scale C++ Software Design*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201633620) (John Lakos) Lakos explains techniques to manage very big C++ software projects. Certainly, a good read, if it only was up to date. It was written long before C++ 98 and misses on many features (e.g. namespaces) important for large-scale projects. If you need to work on a big C++ software project, you might want to read it, although you need to take more than a grain of salt with it. Not to be confused with the extended and later book series Large Scale C++ volume I-III.
- [*Inside the C++ Object Model*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201834545) (Stanley Lippman) If you want to know how virtual member functions are commonly implemented and how base objects are commonly laid out in memory in a multi-inheritance scenario, and how all this affects performance, this is where you will find thorough discussions of such topics.
- [*The Annotated C++ Reference Manual*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201514591) (Bjarne Stroustrup, Margaret A. Ellis) This book is quite outdated in the fact that it explores the 1989 C++ 2.0 version - Templates, exceptions, namespaces, and new casts were not yet introduced. Saying that however, this book goes through the entire C++ standard of the time explaining the rationale, the possible implementations, and features of the language. This is not a book to learn programming principles and patterns on C++, but to understand every aspect of the C++ language.
- [*Thinking in C++*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0139798099) (Bruce Eckel, 2nd Edition, 2000). Two volumes; is a tutorial-style *free* set of intro-level books. Downloads: [vol 1](https://ia800100.us.archive.org/10/items/TICPP2ndEdVolOne/TICPP-2nd-ed-Vol-one.zip), [vol 2](https://ia800108.us.archive.org/24/items/TICPP2ndEdVolTwo/TICPP-2nd-ed-Vol-two.zip). Unfortunately, they're marred by a number of trivial errors (e.g. maintaining that temporaries are automatic `const`), with no official errata list. A partial 3rd party errata list is available at http://www.computersciencelab.com/Eckel.htm, but it is apparently not maintained.
- [*Scientific and Engineering C++: An Introduction to Advanced Techniques and Examples*](https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201533936) (John Barton and Lee Nackman) It is a comprehensive and very detailed book that tried to explain and make use of all the features available in C++, in the context of numerical methods. It introduced at the time several new techniques, such as the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP, also called Barton-Nackman trick). It pioneered several techniques such as dimensional analysis and automatic differentiation. It came with a lot of compilable and useful code, ranging from an expression parser to a Lapack wrapper. The code is [still available online](https://www.informit.com/store/scientific-and-engineering-c-plus-plus-an-introduction-9780201533934). Unfortunately, the books have become somewhat outdated in style and C++ features, however, it was an incredible tour-de-force at the time (1994, pre-STL). The chapters on dynamics inheritance are a bit complicated to understand and not very useful. An updated version of this classic book that includes move semantics and the lessons learned from the STL would be very nice.

1. **@G Rassovsky**: 所有承诺在Y小时内教会X的书籍都应该避免，例如"24小时内学会C++"。- akhil_mittal, 评论于2014年12月29日
2. **用户1630889**: 尽管我尊重Bruce Eckel将他的材料免费在线发布，但我不推荐他的《Thinking in C++》。书中的观点表明了相对糟糕或效果不佳的C++和"面向对象"编程的使用，类似于GoF设计模式的不当应用。我发现它是一本有趣的通用编程入门书籍，但随着某人对编程和（尤其是）计算机科学整体的熟悉，我发现纯粹以"经典"OOP术语思考的书籍对教育有害。- 用户1630889, 评论于2015年1月16日
3. **Zaphod Beeblebrox**: 在accu.org网站上，有一个书籍评论部分和评级。你可以搜索C++的评论。它们中的许多被评为"不推荐"。- Zaphod Beeblebrox, 评论于2016年1月26日
4. **haccks**: 我有一个反推荐："Let Us C++ by Yashavant Kanetkar"。这是一本完全的垃圾书。我请求所有初学者/程序员不要读这本书。读这本书就像是在章节中教你2+2=4，然后在练习中让你计算宇宙的面积。非常令人沮丧。- haccks, 评论于2022年4月3日
5. **Myrddin Krustowski**: 可以添加Nicolai Josuttis的《C++ Move Semantics - The Complete Guide》到列表中吗？- Myrddin Krustowski, 评论于2022年6月14日
6. **ThisClark**: 关于Meyers的《Effective C++》"这是以成为C++程序员应该阅读的最好的第二本书为目标而写的，并且它成功了。"...那么C++程序员应该阅读的最好的第一本书是什么？- ThisClark, 评论于2022年12月14日
7. **Autechre**: 我认为Marc Gregoire的《Professional C++》怎么样？- Autechre, 评论于2023年2月10日
8. **Autechre**: 数组中有一个小错误。《C++ Primer》并没有涵盖C++的所有内容，因为它根本没有涵盖多线程。- Autechre, 评论于2023年2月10日
9. **Joe**: Steve Oualline的《Practical C++ Programming》是一本很棒的书。我发现它对指针和引用特别有帮助，尤其是对于初学者。- Joe, 评论于2023年3月13日
10. **Wayne DSouza**: 评论Prata是有偏见的。它假设了某种模式并寻找一种思想流派，未能考虑到这本书是试图理解语言的人的一个很好的工具。- Wayne DSouza, 评论于2023年6月15日
11. **Reed Hedges**: 我想知道如果这个表格包括每本书的出版日期（每个版本的出版日期）以及涵盖的C++语言版本，会不会有帮助？我可以添加这些吗？- Reed Hedges, 评论于2023年7月11日
12. **Cubbi**: 我浏览了那本书，它比链接的评论建议的还要糟糕。- Cubbi, 评论于2023年8月15日
13. **Justme0**: 增加一本中文书籍：《STL源码剖析》侯捷著 : ) - Justme0, 评论于2023年8月24日
14. **Ryan Lundy**: 我对《C++ Primer》如此受推荐感到有点惊讶。它可能很全面，但也像泥土一样枯燥无味。我不得不强迫自己阅读它。Stroustrup的书更易读。- Ryan Lundy, 评论于2023年9月13日
15. **akuzminykh**: 我们可以添加一列，说明一本书是否有练习吗？- akuzminykh, 评论于4月14日18:35
16. **Meenohara**: Robert Lafore的《Object-Oriented Programming in C++》用于基本概念。- Meenohara, 评论于5月1日9:40
